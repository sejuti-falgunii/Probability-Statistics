# Probability
* Probability is a mathematical framework for dealing with uncertainty (randomness). 
### Sample Space: 
* The set of all possible outcomes in an experiment. 
    * **Mutually Exclusive:** One outcome happening means others don't happen.
    * **Collectively Exhaustive:** The set includes all possible outcomes (at least one outcome must occur). 

* There can be numerous details in practical scenarios, what we consider relevant depends on our judgment, making it an art.
* Sequential Description is useful when the experiment has multiple stages (A tree-based).

* Sample space could be infinite.

* The probability of hitting a specific point in this rectangle to infinite percision will be intuitively 0. (not helpful) So its better to assign probabilities to subsets of the sample space. So we can measure the probability of a event to occur or not. 
* AXIOMS
  *It has to be non negative.
